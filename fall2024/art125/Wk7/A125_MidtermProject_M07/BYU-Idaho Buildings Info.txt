BYU-Idaho CenterThis unique facility is the BYU-Idaho Center. Dedicated in December 2010, the BYU-Idaho Center has become the university's central gathering place. With nearly 435,000 square feet of space, this multi-purpose building is essentially two facilities in one, containing a 15,000-seat auditorium and a large, multi-use activities center complete with an indoor track. This ingenious design, blends space for worship and other events into one cohesive structure. Manwaring CenterLocated near the center of campus, the Hyrum Manwaring Center was named after the president who guided BYU–Idaho through the Great Depression and World War II.

In addition to these features, you can reserve study rooms, play games with friends, or print a project in the Print Shop. There’s always something to do at the MC.Hart BuildingThe Hart building was named for a prominent Idaho state legislator who served on the school’s Board of Education for over 20 years.

The Fitness Center includes treadmills, ellipticals, rowing machines and bikes, a spinning section where classes are held, and an open gym area with dumbbells, bench presses, and other various machines.
