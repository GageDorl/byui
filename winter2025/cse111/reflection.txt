Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I think that the final project showed the power of functions the most to me in this class. Seeing an actual program come about by using functions makes them seem a lot more real world to me.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
The value of a test function to me seems to be to test for possible bugs. I think of it as an easy way to test for edge cases that might cause issues.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
My process right now mostly involves reading the error codes or seeing what the problem is, and figuring out where that issue would be happening in the code. I could definitely improve this process with things like breakpoints, but I also like the way that I do it now.
